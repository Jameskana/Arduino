= French AZERTY Keyboard Library for Arduino =

This library allows an Arduino board with USB capabilites to act as a french AZERTY Keyboard.
Being based on HID library you need to include "HID.h" in your sketch.

For more information about the original Keyboard library please visit
http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Keyboard

== limitations ==

This library does not allow a perfect emulation a french AZERTY keyboard, but can be used for ascii characters (see src/KeyBoardAzertyFr.cpp).

== How to use ==

This library should be used like the original Keyboard Library. Simply use KeyboardAzertyFr instead of Keyboard (i.e. KeyboardAzertyFr.write('a') instead of Keyboard.write('a')).
