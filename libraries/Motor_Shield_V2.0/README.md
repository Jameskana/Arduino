The Motor Shield is a driver module for motors that allows you to use Arduino to control the working speed and direction of the motor. Based on the Dual Full-Bridge Drive Chip L298, it is able to drive two DC motors or a step motor. The Motor Shield can either be powered directly by Arduino or by an external 5V~15V power supply via the DC jack. This module can be used for the development of micro robots and intelligent vehicles, etc.
